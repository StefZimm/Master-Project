**Master Project: Development of a data visualization platform for non-scientists with SOEP Data**

In order to make the SOEP Data inventory of social science data and research results as widely accessible as possible 
and to establish a new culture of using scientific results in other areas of society as well, our master project aims to create 
a platform that allows non-scientists such as journalists or historians to work indirectly with SOEP data without needing direct data access.

The Master Project folder contains the code for a Shiny App, which is intended to provide small descriptive 
analyses of the [WSOEP (Socio-economic Panel)](https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.678568.en/research_data_center_soep.html).

**Organization of the Master Project:** 

The repository of the Master Project is divided into the 3 main folders input and scripts.
